Tasks

1. Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between revenue and the number of installs for paid apps only. Add a trendline to show the correlation and color-code the points based on app categories.

2. Create an interactive Choropleth map using Plotly to visualize global installs by Category. Apply filters to show data for only the top 5 app categories and highlight category where the number of installs exceeds 1 million. The app category should not start with the characters “A,” “C,” “G,” or “S.” This graph should work only between 6 PM IST and 8 PM IST; apart from that time, we should not show it in the dashboard itself.

3. Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of ratings for each app category, but only include categories with more than 50 apps and app name should contain letter “C” and exclude apps with fewer than 10 reviews and rating should be less 4.0. this graph should work only between 4 PM IST to 6 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.
